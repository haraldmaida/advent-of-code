//! # Advent of Code 2019
//!
//! Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering
//! presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space,
//! safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas,
//! he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.
//!
//! Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each
//! day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete
//! the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
//!
