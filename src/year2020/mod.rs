//! # Advent of Code 2020
//!
//! After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a
//! vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go
//! on without you.
//!
//! The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The
//! gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just
//! call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them,
//! but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you
//! arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
//!
//! To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
//!
//! Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
//! each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
//! complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
//!
