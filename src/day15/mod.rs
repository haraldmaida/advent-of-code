//! # Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation
//!
//! You catch the airport shuttle and try to book a new flight to your vacation
//! island. Due to the storm, all direct flights have been cancelled, but a
//! route is available to get around the storm. You take it.
//!
//! While you wait for your flight, you decide to check in with the Elves back
//! at the North Pole. They're playing a memory game and are ever so excited to
//! explain the rules!
//!
//! In this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking
//! turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then,
//! each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:
//!
//! * If that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player
//!   says 0.
//! * Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces
//!   how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.
//!
//! So, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking
//! aloud either 0 (if the last number is new) or an age (if the last number is
//! a repeat).
//!
//! For example, suppose the starting numbers are 0,3,6:
//!
//! * Turn 1: The 1st number spoken is a starting number, 0.
//! * Turn 2: The 2nd number spoken is a starting number, 3.
//! * Turn 3: The 3rd number spoken is a starting number, 6.
//! * Turn 4: Now, consider the last number spoken, 6. Since that was the first
//!   time the number had been spoken, the 4th number spoken is 0.
//! * Turn 5: Next, again consider the last number spoken, 0. Since it had been
//!   spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference between the turn
//!   number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, 4) and the turn number
//!   of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn 1). Thus, the
//!   5th number spoken is 4 - 1, 3.
//! * Turn 6: The last number spoken, 3 had also been spoken before, most
//!   recently on turns 5 and 2. So, the 6th number spoken is 5 - 2, 3.
//! * Turn 7: Since 3 was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns
//!   are 1 turn apart, the 7th number spoken is 1.
//! * Turn 8: Since 1 is new, the 8th number spoken is 0.
//! * Turn 9: 0 was last spoken on turns 8 and 4, so the 9th number spoken is
//!   the difference between them, 4.
//! * Turn 10: 4 is new, so the 10th number spoken is 0.
//!
//! (The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready,
//! whichever comes first.)
//!
//! Their question for you is: what will be the 2020th number spoken? In the
//! example above, the 2020th number spoken will be 436.
//!
//! Here are a few more examples:
//!
//! * Given the starting numbers 1,3,2, the 2020th number spoken is 1.
//! * Given the starting numbers 2,1,3, the 2020th number spoken is 10.
//! * Given the starting numbers 1,2,3, the 2020th number spoken is 27.
//! * Given the starting numbers 2,3,1, the 2020th number spoken is 78.
//! * Given the starting numbers 3,2,1, the 2020th number spoken is 438.
//! * Given the starting numbers 3,1,2, the 2020th number spoken is 1836.
//!
//! Given your starting numbers, what will be the 2020th number spoken?
//!
//! # Part 2
//!
//! Impressed, the Elves issue you a challenge: determine the 30000000th number
//! spoken. For example, given the same starting numbers as above:
//!
//! * Given 0,3,6, the 30000000th number spoken is 175594.
//! * Given 1,3,2, the 30000000th number spoken is 2578.
//! * Given 2,1,3, the 30000000th number spoken is 3544142.
//! * Given 1,2,3, the 30000000th number spoken is 261214.
//! * Given 2,3,1, the 30000000th number spoken is 6895259.
//! * Given 3,2,1, the 30000000th number spoken is 18.
//! * Given 3,1,2, the 30000000th number spoken is 362.
//!
//! Given your starting numbers, what will be the 30000000th number spoken?
