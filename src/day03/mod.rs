//! # Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory
//!
//! With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport.
//! While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's
//! very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see
//! which angles will take you near the fewest trees.
//!
//! Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer
//! coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open
//! squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:
//!
//! ```text
//! ..##.......
//! #...#...#..
//! .#....#..#.
//! ..#.#...#.#
//! .#...##..#.
//! ..#.##.....
//! .#.#.#....#
//! .#........#
//! #.##...#...
//! #...##....#
//! .#..#...#.#
//! ```
//!
//! These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once
//! involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to
//! the right many times:
//!
//! ```text
//! ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
//! #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
//! .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
//! ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
//! .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
//! ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
//! .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
//! .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
//! #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
//! #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
//! .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
//! ```
//!
//! You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach
//! the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
//!
//! The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper
//! model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you
//! would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:
//!
//! From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is
//! right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from
//! there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.
//!
//! The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where
//! there was an open square and X where there was a tree:
//!
//! ```text
//! ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
//! #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
//! .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
//! ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
//! .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
//! ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
//! .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
//! .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
//! #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
//! #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
//! .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to
//! encounter 7 trees.
//!
//! Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3
//! and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability
//! of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.
//!
//! Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the
//! following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all
//! the way to the bottom:
//!
//! * Right 1, down 1.
//! * Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
//! * Right 5, down 1.
//! * Right 7, down 1.
//! * Right 1, down 2.
//!
//! In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s)
//! respectively; multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.
//!
//! What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on
//! each of the listed slopes?
