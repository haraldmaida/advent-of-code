//! # Day 19: Go With The Flow
//!
//! With the Elves well on their way constructing the North Pole base, you turn
//! your attention back to understanding the inner workings of programming the
//! device.
//!
//! You can't help but notice that the device's opcodes don't contain any flow
//! control like jump instructions. The device's manual goes on to explain:
//!
//! "In programs where flow control is required, the instruction pointer can be
//! bound to a register so that it can be manipulated directly. This way,
//! setr/seti can function as absolute jumps, addr/addi can function as relative
//! jumps, and other opcodes can cause truly fascinating effects."
//!
//! This mechanism is achieved through a declaration like #ip 1, which would
//! modify register 1 so that accesses to it let the program indirectly access
//! the instruction pointer itself. To compensate for this kind of binding,
//! there are now six registers (numbered 0 through 5); the five not bound to
//! the instruction pointer behave as normal. Otherwise, the same rules apply as
//! the last time you worked with this device.
//!
//! When the instruction pointer is bound to a register, its value is written to
//! that register just before each instruction is executed, and the value of
//! that register is written back to the instruction pointer immediately after
//! each instruction finishes execution. Afterward, move to the next instruction
//! by adding one to the instruction pointer, even if the value in the
//! instruction pointer was just updated by an instruction. (Because of this,
//! instructions must effectively set the instruction pointer to the instruction
//! before the one they want executed next.)
//!
//! The instruction pointer is 0 during the first instruction, 1 during the
//! second, and so on. If the instruction pointer ever causes the device to
//! attempt to load an instruction outside the instructions defined in the
//! program, the program instead immediately halts. The instruction pointer
//! starts at 0.
//!
//! It turns out that this new information is already proving useful: the CPU in
//! the device is not very powerful, and a background process is occupying most
//! of its time. You dump the background process' declarations and instructions
//! to a file (your puzzle input), making sure to use the names of the opcodes
//! rather than the numbers.
//!
//! For example, suppose you have the following program:
//!
//! ```text
//! #ip 0
//! seti 5 0 1
//! seti 6 0 2
//! addi 0 1 0
//! addr 1 2 3
//! setr 1 0 0
//! seti 8 0 4
//! seti 9 0 5
//! ```
//!
//! When executed, the following instructions are executed. Each line contains
//! the value of the instruction pointer at the time the instruction started,
//! the values of the six registers before executing the instructions (in square
//! brackets), the instruction itself, and the values of the six registers after
//! executing the instruction (also in square brackets).
//!
//! ```text
//! ip=0 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] seti 5 0 1 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
//! ip=1 [1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] seti 6 0 2 [1, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]
//! ip=2 [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0] addi 0 1 0 [3, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]
//! ip=4 [4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0] setr 1 0 0 [5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]
//! ip=6 [6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0] seti 9 0 5 [6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 9]
//! ```
//!
//! In detail, when running this program, the following events occur:
//!
//! * The first line (#ip 0) indicates that the instruction pointer should be
//!   bound to register 0 in this program. This is not an instruction, and so
//!   the value of the instruction pointer does not change during the processing
//!   of this line.
//! * The instruction pointer contains 0, and so the first instruction is
//!   executed (seti 5 0 1). It updates register 0 to the current instruction
//!   pointer value (0), sets register 1 to 5, sets the instruction pointer to
//!   the value of register 0 (which has no effect, as the instruction did not
//!   modify register 0), and then adds one to the instruction pointer.
//! * The instruction pointer contains 1, and so the second instruction, seti 6
//!   0 2, is executed. This is very similar to the instruction before it: 6 is
//!   stored in register 2, and the instruction pointer is left with the value
//!   2.
//! * The instruction pointer is 2, which points at the instruction addi 0 1 0.
//!   This is like a relative jump: the value of the instruction pointer, 2, is
//!   loaded into register 0. Then, addi finds the result of adding the value in
//!   register 0 and the value 1, storing the result, 3, back in register 0.
//!   Register 0 is then copied back to the instruction pointer, which will
//!   cause it to end up 1 larger than it would have otherwise and skip the next
//!   instruction (addr 1 2 3) entirely. Finally, 1 is added to the instruction
//!   pointer.
//! * The instruction pointer is 4, so the instruction setr 1 0 0 is run. This
//!   is like an absolute jump: it copies the value contained in register 1, 5,
//!   into register 0, which causes it to end up in the instruction pointer. The
//!   instruction pointer is then incremented, leaving it at 6.
//! * The instruction pointer is 6, so the instruction seti 9 0 5 stores 9 into
//!   register 5. The instruction pointer is incremented, causing it to point
//!   outside the program, and so the program ends.
//!
//! What value is left in register 0 when the background process halts?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! A new background process immediately spins up in its place. It appears
//! identical, but on closer inspection, you notice that this time, register 0
//! started with the value 1.
//!
//! What value is left in register 0 when this new background process halts?
//!
