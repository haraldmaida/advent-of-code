//! # Day 14: Chocolate Charts
//!
//! You finally have a chance to look at all of the produce moving around.
//! Chocolate, cinnamon, mint, chili peppers, nutmeg, vanilla... the Elves must
//! be growing these plants to make hot chocolate! As you realize this, you hear
//! a conversation in the distance. When you go to investigate, you discover two
//! Elves in what appears to be a makeshift underground kitchen/laboratory.
//!
//! The Elves are trying to come up with the ultimate hot chocolate recipe;
//! they're even maintaining a scoreboard which tracks the quality score (0-9)
//! of each recipe.
//!
//! Only two recipes are on the board: the first recipe got a score of 3, the
//! second, 7. Each of the two Elves has a current recipe: the first Elf starts
//! with the first recipe, and the second Elf starts with the second recipe.
//!
//! To create new recipes, the two Elves combine their current recipes. This
//! creates new recipes from the digits of the sum of the current recipes'
//! scores. With the current recipes' scores of 3 and 7, their sum is 10, and so
//! two new recipes would be created: the first with score 1 and the second with
//! score 0. If the current recipes' scores were 2 and 3, the sum, 5, would only
//! create one recipe (with a score of 5) with its single digit.
//!
//! The new recipes are added to the end of the scoreboard in the order they are
//! created. So, after the first round, the scoreboard is 3, 7, 1, 0.
//!
//! After all new recipes are added to the scoreboard, each Elf picks a new
//! current recipe. To do this, the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a
//! number of recipes equal to 1 plus the score of their current recipe. So,
//! after the first round, the first Elf moves forward 1 + 3 = 4 times, while
//! the second Elf moves forward 1 + 7 = 8 times. If they run out of recipes,
//! they loop back around to the beginning. After the first round, both Elves
//! happen to loop around until they land on the same recipe that they had in
//! the beginning; in general, they will move to different recipes.
//!
//! Drawing the first Elf as parentheses and the second Elf as square brackets,
//! they continue this process:
//!
//! ```text
//! (3)[7]
//! (3)[7] 1  0
//!  3  7  1 [0](1) 0
//!  3  7  1  0 [1] 0 (1)
//! (3) 7  1  0  1  0 [1] 2
//!  3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2 [4]
//!  3  7  1 [0] 1  0 (1) 2  4  5
//!  3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1
//!  3 (7) 1  0  1  0 [1] 2  4  5  1  5
//!  3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2 [4](5) 1  5  8
//!  3 (7) 1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5  1  5  8 [9]
//!  3  7  1  0  1  0  1 [2] 4 (5) 1  5  8  9  1  6
//!  3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5 [1] 5  8  9  1 (6) 7
//!  3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2  4  5  1  5 [8] 9  1  6  7  7
//!  3  7 [1] 0  1  0 (1) 2  4  5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9
//!  3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9  2
//! ```
//!
//! The Elves think their skill will improve after making a few recipes (your
//! puzzle input). However, that could take ages; you can speed this up
//! considerably by identifying the scores of the ten recipes after that. For
//! example:
//!
//! * If the Elves think their skill will improve after making 9 recipes, the
//!   scores of the ten recipes after the first nine on the scoreboard would be
//!   5158916779 (highlighted in the last line of the diagram).
//! * After 5 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 0124515891.
//! * After 18 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 9251071085.
//! * After 2018 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 5941429882.
//!
//! What are the scores of the ten recipes immediately after the number of
//! recipes in your puzzle input?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! As it turns out, you got the Elves' plan backwards. They actually want to
//! know how many recipes appear on the scoreboard to the left of the first
//! recipes whose scores are the digits from your puzzle input.
//!
//! * 51589 first appears after 9 recipes.
//! * 01245 first appears after 5 recipes.
//! * 92510 first appears after 18 recipes.
//! * 59414 first appears after 2018 recipes.
//!
//! How many recipes appear on the scoreboard to the left of the score sequence
//! in your puzzle input?
