//! # Day 9: Marble Mania
//!
//! ## Part 1
//!
//! You talk to the Elves while you wait for your navigation system to
//! initialize. To pass the time, they introduce you to their favorite marble
//! game.
//!
//! The Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a circle
//! according to very particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with 0
//! and increasing by 1 until every marble has a number.
//!
//! First, the marble numbered 0 is placed in the circle. At this point, while
//! it contains only a single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both
//! clockwise from itself and counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is
//! designated the current marble.
//!
//! Then, each Elf takes a turn placing the lowest-numbered remaining marble
//! into the circle between the marbles that are 1 and 2 marbles clockwise of
//! the current marble. (When the circle is large enough, this means that there
//! is one marble between the marble that was just placed and the current
//! marble.) The marble that was just placed then becomes the current marble.
//!
//! However, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a
//! multiple of 23, something entirely different happens. First, the current
//! player keeps the marble they would have placed, adding it to their score. In
//! addition, the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble is
//! removed from the circle and also added to the current player's score. The
//! marble located immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes
//! the new current marble.
//!
//! For example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value 0 is
//! placed in the middle, each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn.
//! The result of each of those turns would produce circles of marbles like
//! this, where clockwise is to the right and the resulting current marble is in
//! parentheses:
//!
//! ```text
//! [-] (0)
//! [1]  0 (1)
//! [2]  0 (2) 1
//! [3]  0  2  1 (3)
//! [4]  0 (4) 2  1  3
//! [5]  0  4  2 (5) 1  3
//! [6]  0  4  2  5  1 (6) 3
//! [7]  0  4  2  5  1  6  3 (7)
//! [8]  0 (8) 4  2  5  1  6  3  7
//! [9]  0  8  4 (9) 2  5  1  6  3  7
//! [1]  0  8  4  9  2(10) 5  1  6  3  7
//! [2]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5(11) 1  6  3  7
//! [3]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1(12) 6  3  7
//! [4]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6(13) 3  7
//! [5]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3(14) 7
//! [6]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7(15)
//! [7]  0(16) 8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [8]  0 16  8(17) 4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [9]  0 16  8 17  4(18) 9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [1]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9(19) 2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [2]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2(20)10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [3]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2 20 10(21) 5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [4]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2 20 10 21  5(22)11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [5]  0 16  8 17  4 18(19) 2 20 10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [6]  0 16  8 17  4 18 19  2(24)20 10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! [7]  0 16  8 17  4 18 19  2 24 20(25)10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15
//! ```
//!
//! The goal is to be the player with the highest score after the last marble is
//! used up. Assuming the example above ends after the marble numbered 25, the
//! winning score is 23+9=32 (because player 5 kept marble 23 and removed marble
//! 9, while no other player got any points in this very short example game).
//!
//! Here are a few more examples:
//!
//! * 10 players; last marble is worth 1618 points: high score is 8317
//! * 13 players; last marble is worth 7999 points: high score is 146373
//! * 17 players; last marble is worth 1104 points: high score is 2764
//! * 21 players; last marble is worth 6111 points: high score is 54718
//! * 30 players; last marble is worth 5807 points: high score is 37305
//!
//! What is the winning Elf's score?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! Amused by the speed of your answer, the Elves are curious:
//!
//! What would the new winning Elf's score be if the number of the last marble
//! were 100 times larger?
//!
