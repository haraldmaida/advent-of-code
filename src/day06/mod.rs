//! # Day 6: Custom Customs
//!
//! As your flight approaches the regional airport where you'll switch to a much
//! larger plane, customs declaration forms are distributed to the passengers.
//!
//! The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z. All you
//! need to do is identify the questions for which anyone in your group answers
//! "yes". Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.
//!
//! However, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing a language
//! barrier and asks if you can help. For each of the people in their group, you
//! write down the questions for which they answer "yes", one per line. For
//! example:
//!
//! ```text
//! abcx
//! abcy
//! abcz
//! ```
//!
//! In this group, there are 6 questions to which anyone answered "yes":
//! a, b, c, x, y, and z. (Duplicate answers to the same question don't count
//! extra; each question counts at most once.)
//!
//! Another group asks for your help, then another, and eventually you've
//! collected answers from every group on the plane (your puzzle input). Each
//! group's answers are separated by a blank line, and within each group, each
//! person's answers are on a single line. For example:
//!
//! ```text
//! abc
//!
//! a
//! b
//! c
//!
//! ab
//! ac
//!
//! a
//! a
//! a
//! a
//!
//! b
//! ```
//!
//! This list represents answers from five groups:
//!
//! * The first group contains one person who answered "yes" to 3 questions:
//!   a, b, and c.
//! * The second group contains three people; combined, they answered "yes" to
//!   3 questions: a, b, and c.
//! * The third group contains two people; combined, they answered "yes" to
//!   3 questions: a, b, and c.
//! * The fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered "yes" to
//!   only 1 question, a.
//! * The last group contains one person who answered "yes" to only 1 question,
//!   b.
//!
//! In this example, the sum of these counts is `3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11`.
//!
//! For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered
//! "yes". What is the sum of those counts?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! As you finish the last group's customs declaration, you notice that you
//! misread one word in the instructions:
//!
//! You don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered "yes"; you
//! need to identify the questions to which everyone answered "yes"!
//!
//! Using the same example as above:
//!
//! ```text
//! abc
//!
//! a
//! b
//! c
//!
//! ab
//! ac
//!
//! a
//! a
//! a
//! a
//!
//! b
//! ```
//!
//! This list represents answers from five groups:
//!
//! * In the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 3 questions:
//!   a, b, and c.
//! * In the second group, there is no question to which everyone answered
//!   "yes".
//! * In the third group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a. Since
//!   some people did not answer "yes" to b or c, they don't count.
//! * In the fourth group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a.
//! * In the fifth group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 1 question,
//!   b.
//!
//! In this example, the sum of these counts is `3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.
//!
//! For each group, count the number of questions to which everyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?
