//! # Day 4: Repose Record
//!
//! ## Part 1
//!
//! You've sneaked into another supply closet - this time, it's across from the
//! prototype suit manufacturing lab. You need to sneak inside and fix the
//! issues with the suit, but there's a guard stationed outside the lab, so this
//! is as close as you can safely get.
//!
//! As you search the closet for anything that might help, you discover that
//! you're not the first person to want to sneak in. Covering the walls, someone
//! has spent an hour starting every midnight for the past few months secretly
//! observing this guard post! They've been writing down the ID of the one guard
//! on duty that night - the Elves seem to have decided that one guard was
//! enough for the overnight shift - as well as when they fall asleep or wake up
//! while at their post (your puzzle input).
//!
//! For example, consider the following records, which have already been
//! organized into chronological order:
//!
//! ```text
//! [1518-11-01 00:00] Guard #10 begins shift
//! [1518-11-01 00:05] falls asleep
//! [1518-11-01 00:25] wakes up
//! [1518-11-01 00:30] falls asleep
//! [1518-11-01 00:55] wakes up
//! [1518-11-01 23:58] Guard #99 begins shift
//! [1518-11-02 00:40] falls asleep
//! [1518-11-02 00:50] wakes up
//! [1518-11-03 00:05] Guard #10 begins shift
//! [1518-11-03 00:24] falls asleep
//! [1518-11-03 00:29] wakes up
//! [1518-11-04 00:02] Guard #99 begins shift
//! [1518-11-04 00:36] falls asleep
//! [1518-11-04 00:46] wakes up
//! [1518-11-05 00:03] Guard #99 begins shift
//! [1518-11-05 00:45] falls asleep
//! [1518-11-05 00:55] wakes up
//! ```
//!
//! Timestamps are written using year-month-day hour:minute format. The guard
//! falling asleep or waking up is always the one whose shift most recently
//! started. Because all asleep/awake times are during the midnight hour
//! (00:00 - 00:59), only the minute portion (00 - 59) is relevant for those
//! events.
//!
//! Visually, these records show that the guards are asleep at these times:
//!
//! ```text
//! Date   ID   Minute
//!             000000000011111111112222222222333333333344444444445555555555
//!             012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
//! 11-01  #10  .....####################.....#########################.....
//! 11-02  #99  ........................................##########..........
//! 11-03  #10  ........................#####...............................
//! 11-04  #99  ....................................##########..............
//! 11-05  #99  .............................................##########.....
//! ```
//!
//! The columns are Date, which shows the month-day portion of the relevant day;
//! ID, which shows the guard on duty that day; and Minute, which shows the
//! minutes during which the guard was asleep within the midnight hour. (The
//! Minute column's header shows the minute's ten's digit in the first row and
//! the one's digit in the second row.) Awake is shown as ., and asleep is shown
//! as #.
//!
//! Note that guards count as asleep on the minute they fall asleep, and they
//! count as awake on the minute they wake up. For example, because Guard #10
//! wakes up at 00:25 on 1518-11-01, minute 25 is marked as awake.
//!
//! If you can figure out the guard most likely to be asleep at a specific time,
//! you might be able to trick that guard into working tonight so you can have
//! the best chance of sneaking in. You have two strategies for choosing the
//! best guard/minute combination.
//!
//! **Strategy 1:** Find the guard that has the most minutes asleep. What minute
//! does that guard spend asleep the most?
//!
//! In the example above, Guard #10 spent the most minutes asleep, a total of
//! 50 minutes (20+25+5), while Guard #99 only slept for a total of 30 minutes
//! (10+10+10). Guard #10 was asleep most during minute 24 (on two days, whereas
//! any other minute the guard was asleep was only seen on one day).
//!
//! While this example listed the entries in chronological order, your entries
//! are in the order you found them. You'll need to organize them before they
//! can be analyzed.
//!
//! What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose?
//! <br/>(In the above example, the answer would be 10 * 24 = 240.)
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! **Strategy 2:** Of all guards, which guard is most frequently asleep on the
//! same minute?
//!
//! In the example above, Guard #99 spent minute 45 asleep more than any other
//! guard or minute - three times in total. (In all other cases, any guard spent
//! any minute asleep at most twice.)
//!
//! What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose?
//! (In the above example, the answer would be 99 * 45 = 4455.)
//!
