//! # Day 12: Subterranean Sustainability
//!
//! The year 518 is significantly more underground than your history books
//! implied. Either that, or you've arrived in a vast cavern network under the
//! North Pole.
//!
//! After exploring a little, you discover a long tunnel that contains a row of
//! small pots as far as you can see to your left and right. A few of them
//! contain plants - someone is trying to grow things in these
//! geothermally-heated caves.
//!
//! The pots are numbered, with 0 in front of you. To the left, the pots are
//! numbered -1, -2, -3, and so on; to the right, 1, 2, 3.... Your puzzle input
//! contains a list of pots from 0 to the right and whether they do (#) or do
//! not (.) currently contain a plant, the initial state. (No other pots
//! currently contain plants.) For example, an initial state of #..##....
//! indicates that pots 0, 3, and 4 currently contain plants.
//!
//! Your puzzle input also contains some notes you find on a nearby table:
//! someone has been trying to figure out how these plants spread to nearby
//! pots. Based on the notes, for each generation of plants, a given pot has or
//! does not have a plant based on whether that pot (and the two pots on either
//! side of it) had a plant in the last generation. These are written as LLCRR
//! => N, where L are pots to the left, C is the current pot being considered, R
//! are the pots to the right, and N is whether the current pot will have a
//! plant in the next generation. For example:
//!
//! * A note like `..#.. => .` means that a pot that contains a plant but with
//!   no plants within two pots of it will not have a plant in it during the
//!   next generation.
//! * A note like `##.## => .` means that an empty pot with two plants on each
//!   side of it will remain empty in the next generation.
//! * A note like `.##.# => #` means that a pot has a plant in a given
//!   generation if, in the previous generation, there were plants in that pot,
//!   the one immediately to the left, and the one two pots to the right, but
//!   not in the ones immediately to the right and two to the left.
//!
//! It's not clear what these plants are for, but you're sure it's important, so
//! you'd like to make sure the current configuration of plants is sustainable
//! by determining what will happen after 20 generations.
//!
//! For example, given the following input:
//!
//! ```text
//! initial state: #..#.#..##......###...###
//!
//! ...## => #
//! ..#.. => #
//! .#... => #
//! .#.#. => #
//! .#.## => #
//! .##.. => #
//! .#### => #
//! #.#.# => #
//! #.### => #
//! ##.#. => #
//! ##.## => #
//! ###.. => #
//! ###.# => #
//! ####. => #
//! ```
//!
//! For brevity, in this example, only the combinations which do produce a plant
//! are listed. (Your input includes all possible combinations.) Then, the next
//! 20 generations will look like this:
//!
//! ```text
//!                  1         2         3
//!        0         0         0         0
//!  0: ...#..#.#..##......###...###...........
//!  1: ...#...#....#.....#..#..#..#...........
//!  2: ...##..##...##....#..#..#..##..........
//!  3: ..#.#...#..#.#....#..#..#...#..........
//!  4: ...#.#..#...#.#...#..#..##..##.........
//!  5: ....#...##...#.#..#..#...#...#.........
//!  6: ....##.#.#....#...#..##..##..##........
//!  7: ...#..###.#...##..#...#...#...#........
//!  8: ...#....##.#.#.#..##..##..##..##.......
//!  9: ...##..#..#####....#...#...#...#.......
//! 10: ..#.#..#...#.##....##..##..##..##......
//! 11: ...#...##...#.#...#.#...#...#...#......
//! 12: ...##.#.#....#.#...#.#..##..##..##.....
//! 13: ..#..###.#....#.#...#....#...#...#.....
//! 14: ..#....##.#....#.#..##...##..##..##....
//! 15: ..##..#..#.#....#....#..#.#...#...#....
//! 16: .#.#..#...#.#...##...#...#.#..##..##...
//! 17: ..#...##...#.#.#.#...##...#....#...#...
//! 18: ..##.#.#....#####.#.#.#...##...##..##..
//! 19: .#..###.#..#.#.#######.#.#.#..#.#...#..
//! 20: .#....##....#####...#######....#.#..##.
//! ```
//!
//! The generation is shown along the left, where 0 is the initial state. The
//! pot numbers are shown along the top, where 0 labels the center pot,
//! negative-numbered pots extend to the left, and positive pots extend toward
//! the right. Remember, the initial state begins at pot 0, which is not the
//! leftmost pot used in this example.
//!
//! After one generation, only seven plants remain. The one in pot 0 matched the
//! rule looking for ..#.., the one in pot 4 matched the rule looking for .#.#.,
//! pot 9 matched .##.., and so on.
//!
//! In this example, after 20 generations, the pots shown as # contain plants,
//! the furthest left of which is pot -2, and the furthest right of which is pot
//! 34. Adding up all the numbers of plant-containing pots after the 20th
//! generation produces 325.
//!
//! After 20 generations, what is the sum of the numbers of all pots which
//! contain a plant?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! You realize that 20 generations aren't enough. After all, these plants will
//! need to last another 1500 years to even reach your timeline, not to mention
//! your future.
//!
//! After fifty billion (50000000000) generations, what is the sum of the
//! numbers of all pots which contain a plant?
