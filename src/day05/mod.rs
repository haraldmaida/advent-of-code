//! # Day 5: Alchemical Reduction
//!
//! ## Part 1
//!
//! You've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The
//! Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's
//! size reduction capabilities.
//!
//! While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their
//! problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of
//! the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long
//! polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).
//!
//! The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with
//! each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite
//! polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units'
//! polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units
//! with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely
//! different types and do not react.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! * In aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.
//! * In abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys
//!   itself, leaving nothing.
//! * In abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing
//!   happens.
//! * In aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities
//!   match, and so nothing happens.
//!
//! Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:
//!
//! ```text
//! dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
//! dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
//! dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
//! dabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.
//! ```
//!
//! After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.
//!
//! How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned?
//!
//! ## Part 2
//!
//! Time to improve the polymer.
//!
//! One of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from
//! collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type
//! is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of
//! polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.
//!
//! For example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:
//!
//! * Removing all A/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer
//!   produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.
//! * Removing all B/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this
//!   polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.
//! * Removing all C/c units produces dabAaBAaDA. Fully reacting this polymer
//!   produces daDA, which has length 4.
//! * Removing all D/d units produces abAcCaCBAcCcaA. Fully reacting this
//!   polymer produces abCBAc, which has length 6.
//!
//! In this example, removing all C/c units was best, producing the answer 4.
//!
//! What is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all
//! units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?
//!
